MIPS Processor Emulator for UVA CS-4330 (Advanced Computer Architecture)

  This repository holds a fork of an existing code base representing an emulation of a 32-bit MIPS processor. This fork will incremenally be updated with custom optimizations as part of the semester long project.

The main branch contains the stable version of the latest incremental optimization.

Status:

    -Current optimization: O1 (pipeline)
    -WIP optimization: pipelining (cont.)

Known issues to fix:
  
    -none currently, more testing needed
